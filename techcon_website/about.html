            <h2>The History of TechCon</h2>
            <img src="techcon-history-timeline.jpg" alt="Timeline infographic showing TechCon's evolution from 2010 to 2024, featuring key milestones and growth statistics" width="800" height="400">
            
            <p>TechCon began in 2010 as a small gathering of 200 passionate technologists in a San Francisco community center. Founded by software engineer Maria Rodriguez and venture capitalist David Chen, the conference was born from a simple belief: that bringing together diverse voices in technology could accelerate innovation and create meaningful change.</p>
            
            <p>What started as a single-day event has evolved into one of the world's premier technology conferences. By 2015, TechCon had grown to accommodate over 1,500 attendees and expanded to a three-day format. The conference gained international recognition when tech giants like Google, Apple, and Microsoft began sending their top executives as keynote speakers.</p>

            <p>The 2018 conference marked a pivotal moment when TechCon introduced its diversity and inclusion initiative, ensuring that 50% of speakers represented underrepresented groups in technology. This commitment has since become a model for other tech conferences worldwide.</p>
            
            <p>Today, TechCon attracts over 5,000 attendees annually from 50+ countries, featuring cutting-edge presentations on artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotechnology, and sustainable tech solutions. The conference has become a launching pad for groundbreaking innovations, with over 300 startups having presented their ideas on the TechCon stage.</p>
